## Development

1. Follow the "Downloading Unity" section of [JNO modding guide](https://www.simplerockets.com/Forums/View/31506/).
    1. Install Unity 2022.3.20f1 with macOS and Windows build components for mono.
    2. Install the C# IDE of your choice. (Unity defaults to Visual Studio; I use Rider.)
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the KomplexHeat repository.
3. Open the repository as a Unity Project.
4. Follow the JNO modding guide to import the JNO mod tools.
    1. In Unity, Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package, and import the mod tools at `JNO installation directory/ModTools/SimpleRockets2_ModTools.unitypackage`. The default location for this on Windows is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SimpleRockets2\ModTools\SimpleRockets2_ModTools.unitypackage`.
    2. Initialize the mod in Unity via SimpleRockets 2 -> Mod Builder Window -> Start Creating Mod.
5. Install the Harmony Unity plugin.
    1. Download the newest "Fat" version of [Harmony plugin](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases). 
    2. Copy the file `net472/0Harmony.dll` into `Assets/Plugins/Harmony`.
    3. Optionally, you may also include `net472/0Harmony.xml` in `Assets/Plugins/Harmony`.
    4. Focus on Unity. Unity should start importing the plugin automatically.
